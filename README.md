# Why
As a software engineer who has lack of math knowledge, I want to solve some numeric computting problem like how to fit curve from a list of 2D points, how to find the intersection points of two curve, how to solve some function like a + a_1x + a_2 x*x + a_3 x*x*x = 0 ?

Seems like these are very simple math problem right ? but I found that there no explicity c++ library is help to easily solve these problem, but there a lot of library like ALGLIB, lapck, eigen as so on some how have ability to solve these problem, but you need have a lot of math knowledge to find them out.

So, this project is aim to solve problem like I said at first segment by ALGLIB and try to give out very easily understand API to help who have no idea about UBLAS, Linear blablabla, Eigenvalues???, deep numeric computting blablabla to solve your problem.

# Why2
I was a start-up company CTO, at least some days ago, because some tough reason I need start find a job, so a lot of baisc knowledage need to self-check, I will push some very simple coding test and continue add some basic mathematical library usage for you.
